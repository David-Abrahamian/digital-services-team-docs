# Quick Start - Basic

Here is the link to the slides for the [workshop](/media/workshop9_10_21.pdf).

To begin, visit the GitHub repository for the documentation here:

 - [https://github.com/LACMTA/digital-services-team-docs/](https://github.com/LACMTA/digital-services-team-docs/){target=_blank}

Make sure you are on the `dev` branch or your own branch.

!!! note
    If you do not have access to the repository, you can request access from [Nina][nina-kin]. Otherwise you will end up forking the repository and will need to make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) from your own repository. Learn more about forking here:
