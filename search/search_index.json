Mission/Goal \u00b6 To bring our customers into every stage of the design process in order to build great digital products for the greatest number of people. We will do this by focusing on inclusivity, reducing barriers and providing a Digital Customer Experience that is easy, fast, safe and reliable. This will build trust which will translate to better engagement, retention and affinity for Metro and our brand. Our Values align with what our Customer Value \u00b6 Fast \u00b6 Whether it's faster travel options or finding related riding information, we want our customers to complete their task as quickly as possible. Easy \u00b6 Our customers have more convenient options. A seamless customer experience with accurate data suited to how and where they want it will provide a better trip experience and make riding Metro a more competitive option. Safe \u00b6 Digital has an ability to influence and promote a safer customer experience from before they ride to after they get to their destination. Our customers deserve peace of mind. Reliable \u00b6 Our customers should be able to trust us. Digital should always be working on making what is in our control more accurate, timely and stable. Accessible \u00b6 Availability does not equal accessibility. We want to work with our customers and the communities we serve to get rid of the barriers that create differentiation and separation. To provide equal access to everyone, regardless of identity factors. Equitable \u00b6 Everyone should be provided the information or action they need in the form they need it in order to have a successful experience with Metro. 2.8 million customers rely on Metro.net every year to navigate our system, provide input on projects, look for a job, do business with the agency and give us feedback on their experience. In terms of direct contact with our customers, the website stands shoulder to shoulder with ridership on our system. Sustainable Project Management \u00b6 Long-term maintenance needs and resource allocation is vital to a great CX. Our customer needs fundamentally don't change. The ways we address them do. Recognize that from the perspective of our customers, no solution is perfect, therefore everything is a prototype and we should ensure we have the time, money and resources to continue refining the CX. Accountability \u00b6 Fiscally responsible and consistent evaluation and iteration of our Customer Experience to ensure Metro priorities continue to align with customer needs. Design Principles \u00b6 The following Principles are verbatim from gov.uk 1. Start with user needs \u00b6 Service design starts with identifying user needs. If you don't know what the user needs are, you won't build the right thing. Do research, analyze data, talk to users. Don't make assumptions. Have empathy for users, and remember that what they ask for isn't always what they need. 2. Do less \u00b6 Government should only do what only government can do. If we've found a way of doing something that works, we should make it reusable and shareable instead of reinventing the wheel every time. This means building platforms and registers others can build upon, providing resources (like APIs) that others can use, and linking to the work of others. We should concentrate on the irreducible core. Do not recreate the wheel 3. Design with data \u00b6 In most cases, we can learn from real world behavior by looking at how existing services are used. Let data drive decision-making, not hunches or guesswork. Keep doing that after taking your service live, prototyping and testing with users then iterating in response. Analytics should be built-in, always on and easy to read. They're an essential tool. 4. Do the hard work to make it simple \u00b6 Making something look simple is easy. Making something simple to use is much harder - especially when the underlying systems are complex - but that's what we should be doing. Don't take \"It's always been that way\" for an answer. It's usually more and harder work to make things simple, but it's the right thing to do. 5. Iterate. Then iterate again \u00b6 The best way to build good services is to start small and iterate wildly. Release minimum viable products early, test them with actual users, move from alpha to beta to live adding features, deleting things that don't work and making refinements based on feedback. Iteration reduces risk. It makes big failures unlikely and turns small failures into lessons. If a prototype isn't working, don't be afraid to scrap it and start again. 6. This is for everyone \u00b6 Accessible design is good design. Everything we build should be as inclusive, legible and readable as possible. If we have to sacrifice elegance - so be it. We're building for needs, not audiences. We're designing for the whole country, not just the ones who are used to using the web. The people who most need our services are often the people who find them hardest to use. Let's think about those people from the start. 7. Understand context \u00b6 We're not designing for a screen, we're designing for people. We need to think hard about the context in which they're using our services. Are they in a library? Are they on a phone? Are they only really familiar with Facebook? Have they never used the web before? 8. Build digital services, not websites \u00b6 A service is something that helps people to do something. Our job is to uncover user needs, and build the service that meets those needs. Of course much of that will be pages on the web, but we're not here to build websites. The digital world has to connect to the real world, so we have to think about all aspects of a service, and make sure they add up to something that meets user needs. 9. Be consistent, not uniform \u00b6 We should use the same language and the same design patterns wherever possible. This helps people get familiar with our services, but when this isn't possible we should make sure our approach is consistent. This isn't a straitjacket or a rule book. Every circumstance is different. When we find patterns that work we should share them, and talk about why we use them. But that shouldn't stop us from improving or changing them in the future when we find better ways of doing things or the needs of users change. 10. Make things open: it makes things better \u00b6 We should share what we're doing whenever we can. With colleagues, with users, with the world. Share code, share designs, share ideas, share intentions, share failures. The more eyes there are on a service the better it gets - howlers are spotted, better alternatives are pointed out, the bar is raised. Much of what we're doing is only possible because of open source code and the generosity of the web design community. We should pay that back. Product Cycle \u00b6 Development Approach \u00b6 Utilize open source technologies wherever possible. Open by default. Develop with re-usability and collaboration in mind. Metro.net Rules \u00b6 View Dropbox Lifeboat content guidelines for latest iteration. Use plain language \u00b6 Metro's website is our main touchpoint for the general public and needs to be accessible to people from all walks of life. All content posted to the page needs to be written at a 7th grade reading level or below. This helps us make sure that people from varying backgrounds and education levels can access and engage with Metro. Have clearly defined goals \u00b6 In order to adequately measure and determine how successful a webpage is and make iterative improvements, we need to have goals that align with user needs. If needed, a digital assessment form can be provided to help with this process. Content should be on brand \u00b6 In addition to being accessible, web copy should follow Metro brand guidelines on tone and voice. Specific guidance can be found at brand.metro.net . Metro's website is about our service, project and programs, not our organizational chart ; therefore: No departmental pages ! The website is for riders and information needs to be presented in terms of its value in the customer journey. On the projects side, if a program, practice area, process or concept needs to be explained to give context for an active project, it can be a 'how we plan and build' page and include contact information for an expert on that subject. These pages can also include links to plans and other documents that are relevant to said program, practice area, process or concept. Example template of web content considerations . Other than the Board members (and maybe top executive management\u2026), no bios and headshots should appear on the website. Calendar items for specific events in the Metro Conversations series or other events that may have guest speakers or panelists may include a short bio as part of the event information. No more 'web requests'! \u00b6 Please do not send us copy that has already been finalized for posting verbatim. If copy needs to be updated, provide information on what should be changed to your Marketing Rep for copyediting into the page according to guidelines above. This will help us ensure consistency in tone and voice throughout the site. Date-specific events \u00b6 Events should be created using the calendar tool instead of a webpage for efficiency and search engine optimization. Metro.net is not an archive \u00b6 To avoid legal quandaries and ensure proper ownership of content, we'd like to reiterate that departments are responsible for their own records. Metro.net is a convenience copy not a records system, and when the content is no longer active we should be able to delete it from metro.net If Records Management is asked to locate something, they will reach out to the content creators' departments. It is their responsibility to comply with the records policy and retention schedule, not metro.net. Bi-annual Metro.net review \u00b6 We will run a bi-annual audit of the site to identify low-performing pages and pages that haven't been updated regularly to see if they should be removed for the site. Reviewing analytics and feedback is an important part of regular cleaning and maintenance of the site, and is meant to ensure our customers have a website that is fast, relevant, and easy to use. Pages that are flagged for review will be shared with marketing to determine next steps. How Marketing can Help \u00b6 Marketing should avoid committing to new web projects without first checking in with the webteam. Don't start with the assumption that our partners need a web page, website, web application. We do not have capacity and even if we did, web priorities are tied to Metro's strategic goals.

The vision for this basemap is to bring greater consistency across Metro\u2019s maps, from static printed maps to online interactive applications, for all types of project and service maps. Our new custom basemap will improve efficiency in creating branded online and printed maps by streamlining the styling process, reducing the amount of manual work required to style public-facing maps to Metro brand specifications . This base map is currently in beta version 1.0.4 as of 6/23/21. It is available to select teams as Metro\u2019s Design and Marketing teams refine the map and surrounding processes. Metro\u2019s ArcGIS Online environment includes shared update groups for individual projects and efforts, where files can be shared for collaboration with the Metro team. As with all public-facing information, please work with your Marketing Rep to gain access to the group for your project. USE CASES The process for using the custom basemap will vary depending on the format of your final deliverable. Please follow instructions below based on the planned use for the map that you are developing. In some cases, you will have multiple uses and will need to follow both workflows for using this map.","title":"How to Use the ArcGIS Custom Metro Basemaps (Beta)"},{"location":"projects/ArcGIS/How_to_Use_the_ArcGIS_Custom_Metro_Basemaps_%28Beta%29/#online-maps","text":"For online maps, select the custom Metro basemaps in the \u201cCustom Basemaps\u201d Gallery.

They were separated in 2016 to allow for more regular file updates. Both sets of files are publicly accessible on the LACMTA GitLab account. They were moved from GitHub to GitLab in 2016 because of the 100MB file size limit in GitHub. Service schedules go through a \u201cshakeup\u201d roughly twice a year in June and December. Schedules are adjusted to accommodate ridership demands and improve connections between Metro Bus, Metro Rail, and other transit services in the region. The files hosted on GitLab are used by the Metro Trip Planner as well as many third parties that rely on the data to power their transit trip planning sites and apps. Graph Update \u00b6 OpenTripPlanner builds a Graph.obj using a list of GTFS files defined in a Chef cookbook. That cookbook is scheduled to run daily and it will pull the GTFS files from Metro\u2019s GitLab repository. The cron job schedule for the graph build is: 9 11 \\* \\* \\* Timezone is UTC/ETC. Manual Update \u00b6 If we need OTP to pick up and process the new GTFS files immediately, this is what we do. Access the EC2 grapher server instance via SSH (if you don\u2019t have access you\u2019ll have to use knife to connect to the chef server): metro-us-west-2-otp-grapher-prod-1 Manually run the cookbook to regenerate the graph file using the new GTFS files: sudo chef-client -o recipe \\[ otp-server::update_graph \\] Bus \u00b6 Bus data is updated every 1-2 months. There are a few common issues that show up in validation, but none of them are showstoppers. Update Procedures \u00b6 Clone the GitLab project (repository) to your local workspace: https://gitlab.com/LACMTA/gtfs_bus Operations should have included a validation check with the new GTFS files. Confirm there are no errors. Replace the local files with the new GTFS files. Check the file line endings using this command: file \"FILENAME\" If the output states the file has CRLF line terminators, the file will need to be converted from Windows format to UNIX format. Instead of ending in both Carriage Return (CR) and Line Feed (LF), UNIX files end only in LF. Run the dos2unix command to convert the files: dos2unix agency.txt calendar.txt calendar_dates.txt feed_info.txt routes.txt shapes.txt stop_times.txt stops.txt trips.txt Check the endings again to confirm the line endings are now UNIX format. If so, the output will not say anything about the line endings. file \"FILENAME\" Run the following commands in order to re-generate the zip file with the new GTFS files. rm \\* zip zip -R gtfs_bus \\* .txt Output a list of the files in the zip file: unzip -l gtfs_bus.zip Update the README and include a copy of the output of the unzip command. When complete save all files and use git to push to commit the changes. Finally push the new commit back to the GitLab repository: 1 2 3 git add . git commit -m \"MESSAGE\" git push origin master Rail \u00b6 Rail data files are updated nightly through an automated process. Operations generates the files and they are uploaded to GitLab. The process is undocumented, but this is what is known so far. Operations uses FTP to upload the file to a folder location: The location of the destination, \u201cnextbus/prod/\u201d is currently unknown. The rail update does not usually fail, but when it does, follow the normal procedure to manually update GitLab. Operations will provide the GTFS_Rail_Nextrain.zip file. Clone the gtfs_rail git repository, add the zip file to the directory, then unzip the contents and overwrite existing files: unzip -o GTFS_Rail_Nextrain.zip Run the dos2unix command to convert the file endings: dos2unix agency.txt calendar.txt calendar_dates.txt feed_info.txt routes.txt shapes.txt stop_times.txt stops.txt trips.txt Check the endings to confirm they\u2019re now UNIX format. file \"FILENAME\" Re-generate the zip file with the new GTFS files: rm \\* zip zip -R gtfs_rail agency.txt calendar.txt calendar_dates.txt feed_info.txt routes.txt shapes.txt stop_times.txt stops.txt trips.txt Output a list of the files in the zip file and update this in the README: unzip -l gtfs_bus.zip Commit all the files with a message: git add . git commit -m \"MESSAGE\" Output a list of the file changed and update this in the README: git show \\- -summary \\- -stat Save the README and commit again. Then push the changes to GitLab. Other Agencies (Bus) \u00b6 There is a repo on our GitLab called gtfs_lax that contains GTFS files from agencies across the LA region: [https://gitlab.com/LACMTA/gtfs_lax]{.ul} While it looks like at some point this repo was maintained using a script that pulled files from [MetroCloudAlliance]{.ul} , it has not been updated since April 2017. Without a paid membership we won\u2019t be able to maintain the files in this way. Our Metro Trip Planner does not reference the files at this repo. Instead, the OTP Graph Builder will pull some data directly from their source agencies: LADOT Glendale Long Beach Transit Palos Verdes Pasadena The rest are pulled cached on the media.metro.net S3 bucket. Comparing the two, it seems the gtfs_lax repo contains a lot more agencies than we\u2019re actually loading into the Trip Planner.
